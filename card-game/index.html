	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>PewDiePie & Memes is an upcoming Blockchain based trading cards game. We're not quite 
	there yet, but eventually we are going to deploy all sorts of cool meme related trading cards 
	on the Ethereum Blockchain as ERC721 tokens which means you can own, sell or trade them 
	freely with other people in our decentralized marketplace (a work in progress).</p>
	
	<p>Once we go live, each new player is given a mystery box containing 7 basic level 1 cards 
	that are chosen randomly. Because the cards will be ERC721 tokens, the player can withdraw them 
	to their Ethereum wallet and own them permanently (or until they either sell or trade them away).</p>
	
	<p>The idea is to build a game system similar to the "ladder model" known from fighting games 
	like Tekken where the player "climbs the ladder" playing against tougher and tougher opponents.
	After each successful round the game state is saved to our sidechain, meaning that you can 
	continue where you left off without having to start from level 1.</p>

	<h1>Play the demo</h1>
	
	<p>On the 13th of October 2018 we released a playable demo of PewDiePie & Memes in hopes of 
	spreading awareness of our project as well as give everyone a chance to become familiar 
	with the gameplay itself.<br><br>
	<a class="button" href="game.html" target="_blank">Play the demo!</a>

	<h2>How the game is played</h2>
	
	<div class="responsiveVideo">

	</div>
	<br>
	
	<p>
	This turn based game is played on a 3x3 board where cards are placed as the game 
	progresses. Each card has <strong>four values</strong> shown in the top left corner. 
	Each value <strong>corresponds to one of the four sides</strong> of the card 
	(left value for left side of the card, top value for top side of the card, etc.)
	The values range from 1 to 10 with the value 10 represented by the letter A.<br><br>
	
	The first player is chosen randomly after which they may choose 
	a card to place anywhere on the board. After the first card is placed, the opponent may place a card 
	on any <strong>unoccupied space</strong> on the board.<br><br>
	
	The <strong>color</strong> of the card indicates which player has captured it on the board. All <strong>green</strong> cards 
	are captured by the <strong>player</strong> and all <strong>yellow</strong> cards are captured by the <strong>opponent</strong>.
	The game starts with both players having an equal score of 5 (because they both have 5 cards that haven't been played yet).<br><br>
	
	To win, a majority of the total ten cards played (including the one card that is not placed on the board) 
	must be of the player's card color (green). To do this, the player must capture cards by placing a card adjacent 
	to an opponent's card whereupon the <strong>value of the sides where the two cards touch will be compared</strong>. 
	If the value of the player's card is higher than the opponent's card, the opponent's card will be captured 
	and turned into the player's color (green). The opponent can capture the player's cards the same way.<br><br>
	
	A draw occurs if the player and the opponent possess equal numbers of cards in their color on the board.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Additional rules</h2>
	<p>Placing cards on the board and comparing the value of the touching sides will get boring after a while. 
	But don't worry, there are additional rules which make the game more interesting and allow players to come 
	up with their <strong>own strategies</strong> for beating the opponent even if the opponent's card values 
	are much higher than the player's card values.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Same</h2>
	<p>When a card is placed <strong>touching two or more</strong> other cards (one or both of them have to be the opposite color), 
	and the touching sides of each card is the same (8 touching 8 for example), then the other two cards are captured. 
	Combo rule applies.<br>
	<img class="image fit" src="Same-rule-explained.jpg" alt="Same Rule Explained">
	</p>
	
	<h2>Plus</h2>
	<p>Similar to the Same rule. When one card is placed touching two others and the values that are touching equal 
	the same sum, then both cards are captured. Combo rule applies.<br>
	<img class="image fit" src="Plus-rule-explained.jpg" alt="Plus Rule Explained">
	</p>
	
	<h2>Combo</h2>
	<p>This rule can only be triggered with either the Same or Plus rule. It doesn't occur on its own. The easiest way 
	to understand this rule is to think as if the card <strong>that was captured by Same or Plus</strong> had just been placed on 
	the board and the value of that card is compared to the value of a card adjecent to it. Take a look at the following example:<br>
	
	<img class="image fit" src="Combo-rule-explained.jpg" alt="Combo Rule Explained">
	
	When I place the Earth Sandwhich card into the square indicated by the arrow, it will capture both the 
	PewDiePie Car as well as Dr. Phil cards because of the Plus rule (1+8, 1+8). Now that these two cards are captured, a Combo 
	rule is triggered because the Galaxy Brain card that is adjecent to the Dr. Phil card (captured through Plus),
	has a lower value on the side that is touching the Dr. Phil card. (1 touching 8).<br><br>
	Remember to think as if Dr. Phil had just been placed on the board! Also in this particular example the Combo rule would 
	be triggered through PewDiePie Car as well because the Galaxy Brain has a lower value on that side too.<br><br>
	
	Note: Combo is a very powerful rule because it doesn't stop with just one iteration. It can iterate through the whole 
	board and capture all of the cards given that each time the next card touching the captured card has a lower value.
	</p>

	<h2>Current state of development</h2>
	
	<p>
	Now that the playable demo is finally out it's time to proceed with phase 2!<br><br>
	
	I've been looking more and more into the ERC721 standard, reading every possible guide and tutorial I can find. I know 
	how to create the contract that holds all of the cards and I know how to add new cards into the contract at a later date.<br><br>
	
	I'm currently stuck at figuring out the best way to mint new cards in the contract. Since I want to give everyone 
	a fair chance, I can't just create a contract with all the trading cards and put them for sale for BrofistCoin. That would 
	mean the people who own more BrofistCoin would get an <strong>unfair advantage</strong>.<br><br>
	
	Instead I've been thinking about building the contract in such a way where each new player (who owns 0 cards) is given 
	a mystery box containing 5 randomly picked level 1 cards. In case you didn't know, the trading cards have "levels" ranging 
	from 1 to 10 which reflect their overall rarity (note to self: cards will probably need a multiplier of sorts which 
	tells the card minting function the overall chance for that particular card to get minted).<br><br>
	
	The initial free starter pack should be enough to get everyone started. The "ladder model" mentioned earlier will allow 
	players to play against tougher and tougher opponents. At the bottom of the ladder is the level 1 opponent who will only 
	play using level 1 cards. Upon winning that round, the level 2 opponent will use both level 1 and 2 cards etc. All the 
	way up until the level 10 opponent who uses all the cards available from level 1 to 10 (currently 112 cards).<br><br>
	
	Every time a player wins a round the game will choose a random card <strong>from the current hand</strong> of the opponent and gives the 
	card to the player. This is how you get new cards! (note to self: is this enough to make higher level cards really rare?
	Probably need to use the multiplier too.)<br><br>
	
	Not only do the cards get stronger as the opponent's level increases, the difficulty setting is set out in a way where 
	the opponent is not very smart between levels 1-3, somewhat smart at levels 4-7 and extremely offensive at levels 8-10.
	This will make the stronger opponents harder to beat, forcing the player to come up with a good strategy by taking advantage 
	of the Same, Plus and Combo rules instead of simply placing strong cards all over the table.<br><br>
	
	Naturally there will be a decentralized marketplace for all of these trading cards so if you happen to own multiple, 
	you can sell them to the highest bidder for BrofistCoin ;) I am currently looking at integrating OpeanSea because I heard they 
	allow your own token to be used as currency. <br><br>
	
	And finally I got this really awesome idea of "gilded cards". Whenever the player wins the round and the contract chooses 
	a random card from the opponent's deck to reward the player, there is an insanely small chance for that card to become 
	"gilded" meaning it will have some epic style visual aspects and boosted stats.
