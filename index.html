				<p>These are the words of wisdom of a legendary Youtuber known as PewDiePie who, after 
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz50eTT6y8g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">poking fun</a> at the Bitconnect's pyramid scheme,

			<p>
			BrofistCoin is a fan made <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> powered by the Ethereum blockchain. 
			You can send it to your friends and trade it on an exchange such as
			<a href="https://forkdelta.app/#!/trade/PEW-ETH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ForkDelta</a>.
			<br><br>
			The main purpose of BrofistCoin is to serve as an <strong>incentive for content creators</strong> to come up 
			with top quality, unique and funny memes for the PewDiePie's Last Week I Asked You (LWIAY) show.
			Each week, after the episode, we announce the top 3 meme authors who get to share a pool of 100 
			BrofistCoin based on the total percentage of upvotes received from the PewDiePieSubmissions 
			subreddit.
			<br><br>
			This makes BrofistCoin a meme coin in its most literal sense! It's a meme cryptocurrency for memes
			that you can earn by creating more memes.
			<br><br>
			However, because BrofistCoin lives on the Ethereum blockchain, we can utilize the power of 
			<a href="faq/#SmartContract" target="_blank">Smart Contracts</a> to create all sorts of other cool 
			things too. 
			<br><br>
			It's strongly recommended to read our <a href="faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> to fully understand 
			the concept especially if you are new to Ethereum. It's worth it, I promise!
			
			<h3>Meme Trading Cards</h3>
			We are currently working on Meme related <a href="https://brofistcoin.io/faq#ERC721" target="_blank">ERC721</a> 
			virtual assets known as Meme Trading Cards. 
			This means that in the near future you can use BrofistCoin to buy and sell these rare and ownable virtual 
			memes yourself. Check out our initial concept <a href="https://brofistcoin.io/trading-cards/" target="_blank">here</a>!
			<br><br>
			<img class="image fit" src="images/All-Cards.png" alt="PewDiePie and Memes Related Trading Cards"/>
			You might be wondering how does one acquire these Meme Trading Cards in the first place? Why, through playing 
			our super awesome card game of course ;)
			<br><br>
			Yes, you heard that right! We are working on releasing a full blown trading 
			cards game on the Ethereum platform pretty soon and what's even more amazing is that everyone will have exactly the same 
			chance at receiving any Meme Trading Card simply by playing the game.
			<br><br>
			If you're interested to learn more, we have a whole page dedicated to the project 
			<a href="https://brofistcoin.io/card-game" target="_blank">over here</a> and you can already try out the <strong>playable 
			demo</strong> today. How cool is that?!
			<br><br>
			One more thing... since this is a project with absolutely no funding behind it, we would appreciate a donation of any kind to help us hire 
			graphics designers, solidity developers and social media managers to really make this project awesome. Any ETH or token donations
			welcome: <span class="contractAddr"><strong>0xa8B8DE18b2dC12e755aD9B5805f7aac3d9489C05</strong></span> (Bitcoin is worthless 
			because you can't build stuff on it so we have no need for that lol)

				<p>Whoa! In just under 3 months we distributed all of the 50 million PEW to more than 74,000 addresses. That's crazy!</p>

				<a href="http://forkdelta.github.io/#!/trade/PEW-ETH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ForkDelta</a> where you 
				can sometimes find a pretty good deal. Or better yet, why not post a really funny meme to the

				<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
				
				<p>In case you haven't figured it out already <strong>BrofistCoin is a fan made meme coin</strong>. A joke.
				BrofistCoin offers no guarantees. It's definitely not a good idea to invest your life's savings in BrofistCoin.
				Don't buy it. Not even for free. Seriously. Do not put your life's savings in BrofistCoin. You have been warned.
				As of today <span class="taskComplete">PewDiePie has no idea we're actually doing this.</span> He probably already knows 
				about us. He just hasn't contacted us and isn't working together with us. So don't hold him accountable for anything that may 
				or may not happen. 
				<br><br>
				That said, BrofistCoin is a real and fully functional cryptocurrency that you can send to your friends and family. All you 
				need is an Ethereum address to hold the coin. For more information please check out our <a href="faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> section.
				</p>
				
				<h3>For the investor</h3>
				
				<p>
				About a week and a half after we first announced BrofistCoin at least two different teams have also started promoting their own 
				BrofistCoin cryptocurrency. Please be advised that we are not working together with them and the only official website we have
				is the one you are on right now (BrofistCoin.io). Every other website about BrofistCoin out on the internet is not us and is most 
				likely scam because they are asking for real money as an investment. We never did any of that and neither are we interested in 
				listing our coin on some centralized exchange, sorry.
				<br><br>
				We believe strongly that BrofistCoin should be freely given 
				away to all of PewDiePie fans and frown upon the idea of using Felix Kjellberg's name and trademark to generate profits. This is 
				the main reason why <span class="taskComplete">you can send our smart contract 0 ETH and still receive 
				the same amount of PEW coins.</span> Contract depleted. Doesn't work any more! However we definitely 
				wouldn't mind a donation so feel free to send our smart contract any amount of ETH or other tokens. 
				</p>

				<h3>For PewDiePie</h3>
				
				<p>
				Hopefully you will understand that this is a joke and won't sue us. Our main goal is to have great new content created for 
				your meme review and LWIAY episodes by using BrofistCoin as an incentive to come up with better quality memes. Additionally we're working on
				implementing a reddit tip bot so that the best content submitted on PewDiePie Submissions can earn BrofistCoin as a reward
				for their hard work. 
				<br><br>
				Obviously you, PewDiePie, will be entitled to the biggest BrofistCoin wallet! Unlike our "competitors" we are not 
				raising any money using your trademark. We earned around $100 from donations, but that's all! We would really, really love to hear from 
				you soon to discuss options and perhaps even 
				work together by donating to your chosen charities should the value of PEW raise in the future. It's like you said: 
				<br><br>
				We're gonna brofist our way to the top!
