				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz50eTT6y8g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">poking fun</a> at the Bitconnect's pyramid scheme,

			BroFistCoin (PEW) is a fan made <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> powered by the Ethereum blockchain. 
			You can send it to your friends and trade it on an exchange such as
			<a href="http://forkdelta.github.io/#!/trade/PEW-ETH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ForkDelta</a>.
			<br><br>
			When compared with traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, BroFistCoin comes with significantly <strong>reduced transaction fees</strong> 
			and each transaction will generally confirm way faster as well (about 5-10 minutes in normal conditions).
			<br><br>
			The main purpose of BroFistCoin (for now) is to serve as an incentive for creators to come up with top quality, unique and funny memes for 
			PewDiePie's meme review and LWIAY episodes. Whenever PewDiePie rates a meme highly in one of his videos we will make sure the author of that 
			meme is rewarded PEW coins for their efforts.
			<br><br>
			However, because BroFistCoin lives on the Ethereum blockchain, we can now utilize the power of 
			<a href="faq/#SmartContract" target="_blank">Smart Contracts</a> to create all sorts of other cool things. 
			<br><br>
			For example we have currently started working on a prototype of what you can call "PewDiePie's Collectibles". We're not quite 
			there yet, but eventually you will be able to purchase virtual collectibles with your PEW coins. The first collectible will most likely 
			be the infamous chair that can be bought for 399 PEW coins.
			<br><br>
			It's strongly recommended to read our <a href="faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> to fully understand the concept especially if you are new 
			to Ethereum.
			<br><br>
			And finally, since this is a project with absolutely no funding behind it, we would appreciate a donation of any kind to help us hire 
			graphics designers, solidity developers and social media managers to really make this project awesome. Any ETH or token donations
			welcome: <span class="contractAddr"><strong>0xa8B8DE18b2dC12e755aD9B5805f7aac3d9489C05</strong></span> (Bitcoin is worthless so we don't need it, lol)

				<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
				
				<p>In case you haven't figured it out already <strong>BroFistCoin is a fan made meme coin</strong>. A joke.
				BroFistCoin offers no guarantees. It's definitely not a good idea to invest your life's savings in BroFistCoin.
				Don't buy it. Not even for free. Seriously. Do not put your life's savings in BroFistCoin. You have been warned.
				As of today <span class="taskComplete">PewDiePie has no idea we're actually doing this.</span> He probably already knows 
				about us. He just hasn't contacted us and isn't working together with us. So don't hold him accountable for anything that may 
				or may not happen. 
				<br><br>
				That said, BroFistCoin is a real and fully functional cryptocurrency that you can send to your friends and family. All you 
				need is an Ethereum address to hold the coin. For more information please check out our <a href="faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> section.
				</p>
				
				<h3>For the investor</h3>
				
				<p>
				About a week and a half after we first announced BroFistCoin at least two different teams have also started promoting their own 
				BroFistCoin cryptocurrency. Please be advised that we are not working together with them and the only official website we have
				is the one you are on right now (brofistcoin.io). Every other website about BroFistCoin out on the internet is not us and is most 
				likely scam because they are asking for real money as an investment. 
				<br><br>
				We believe strongly that BroFistCoin should be freely given 
				away to all of PewDiePie fans and frown upon the idea of using Felix Kjellberg's name and trademark to generate profits. This is 
				the main reason why you can send our smart contract 0 ETH and still receive the same amount of PEW coins. However we definitely 
				wouldn't mind a donation so feel free to send our smart contract any amount of ETH.
				</p>

				<h3>For PewDiePie</h3>
				
				<p>
				Hopefully you will understand that this is a joke and won't sue us. Our main goal is to have great new content created for 
				your meme review and LWIAY episodes by using BroFistCoin as an incentive to come up with better quality memes. Additionally we're working on
				implementing a reddit tip bot so that the best content submitted on PewDiePie Submissions can earn BroFistCoin as a reward
				for their hard work. 
				<br><br>
				Obviously you, PewDiePie, will be entitled to the biggest BroFistCoin wallet! Unlike our "competitors" we are not 
				raising any money using your trademark. We would really, really love to hear from you soon to discuss options and perhaps even 
				work together by donating to your chosen charities should the value of PEW raise in the future. It's like you said: 
				<br><br>
				We're gonna brofist our way to the top!
